Disappointed with non availability of Hawaain pizza, as after confirmation of order, restaurant called and asked for substitute topping instead of Pineapple. As Hawaain is not the same in absence of key ingredient.\n\nTaste wise it was OK, but lack of cheese was bit of turn off and even the thin crust was not up to the mark.'), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  We sampled a simple sausage pizza.

I reordered another dish which took another 15 or 20 mins. Mac and Cheese ball were nice, the presentation even better (pics attached). Staff was friendly and prompt. The music was a little too loud for my liking specially for the kind of vibe the restaurant has. Nachos were below par, pizza at par. The catch is that the restaurant applies 18 percent tax.

A great rooftop ambience i must say. As soon as we entered we asked for a place for two and were assisted to the seats. I noticed that the the cushion was dirty, someone had stepped on it. Didn't expected that.\nComing to food... The menu is minimum but still the food was good. We ordered beer at first, we asked if Kingfisher strong beer was available. The guy said yes and served us with Kingfisher Ultra and said it is a strong beer, which clearly wasn't. Anyone can clearly read the alcohol %age and tell which is a strong beer. We took whiskey later.\nThe food took around 20min to serve. We had pork bellies, chicken wing and beef too. The beef was kinda overcooked.\nThe music was loud and our seats were just next to it.

The decor is premium and sophisticated. We were denied sofa seats on pretext that those were already reserved. Ironically I also had reservation but I guess they had their reasons.

I reordered another dish which took another 15 or 20 mins. Mac and Cheese ball were nice, the presentation even better (pics attached). Staff was friendly and prompt. The music was a little too loud for my liking specially for the kind of vibe the restaurant has. Nachos were below par, pizza at par. The catch is that the restaurant applies 18 percent tax.

Individually, the sizzler was decent. Only complaint was that the quantity of rice was very less. The Paneer was soft and well seasoned, but lacked that kick of flavor. The mushrooms were a outstanding. The other veggies occupied space. Rice was also very mildly seasoned. May be its catered to a blander palette.\n\nThem thick skinned potatoes need to be avoided at all costs. Very bland. No salt, spice or anything nice.
